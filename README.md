## Description
Computational analyses of single-cell RNA-sequencing and multiplex immunoassay data from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of preschool children with cystic fibrosis (CF) or on CFTR modulator Elexacaftor/Texacaftor/Ivacaftor (ETI) therapy.

Single-cell RNA-seq data were generated using the Cell Hashing with 10x Single Cell 3' Reagent Kit v3.1 (Dual Index) Protocol.

Multiplex immunoassay data were generated previously using the Bio-Plex Pro Human Inflammation Panel, 37-Plex and Human Cytokine Screening Panel, 48-Plex. For details, refer to:
